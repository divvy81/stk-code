    <!-- turn-speed and turn-radius define the turn radius of the kart at

         The values below define that at speed 0 the turn radius is 3, at
         speed 10 (and up to 25 then) the radius is 15 etc.
         The actual turn radius is piece-wise linearly interpolated. This
         allows for tighter turning at lower speeds, and also avoids that
         the kart becomes too hard to control at high speed (speeds of higher
         than 23 can only be reached with powerups).
         time-full-steer is the time when a player's input goes from neutral
                         steering to extreme left or right.
         time-full-steer-ai is the time for the AI to go from neutral steering to
                         extreme left (or right). This can be used to reduce 
                         'shaking' of AI karts caused by changing steering direction
                         too often. It also helps with making it easier to push the
                         AI karts (otherwise micro-corrections make this nearly
                         impossible). A value of 1/maxFPS / 2 will guarantee that
                         the wheel can go from -1 to +1 steering in one frame,
